# Rooms, State & Threading

## Rooms

A **room** is an isolated conversation boundary. Every event belongs to exactly
one room. Create one with `createRoom`:

```ts
const room = await flow.createRoom({
  creatorId: "u1",
  metadata: { name: "general" },
});
```

## Room state

While the timeline is the full append-only log of everything that happened, the
**state** of a room is the set of *currently active* state events. State events
are keyed by a `[type, stateKey]` pair — publishing a new event with the same
pair supersedes the previous one.

```ts
// The latest event per [type, stateKey]:
const state = await flow.getRoomState(room.id);
```

This is how mutable-looking concepts (a room's name, topic, or a member's role)
are modelled on top of an immutable log: the "current" name is simply the most
recent `room.state.name` event.

## Threading: the DAG

Events can reference other events through `parentEventIds`, forming a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) of edges. This powers:

- **Replies** — a message points at the message it answers.
- **Edits & reactions** — an event points at the event it modifies.
- **Branching timelines** — multiple events can descend from a shared parent.

```ts
await flow.publishEvent({
  roomId: room.id,
  senderId: "u2",
  type: "message.text",
  content: { body: "replying to you" },
  parentEventIds: [originalEvent.id],
});
```

## Reading the timeline

`getRoomTimeline` returns a room's events newest-first, with optional
pagination:

```ts
const recent = await flow.getRoomTimeline(room.id, {
  limit: 50,
  beforeSequenceId: cursor,
});
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can register hooks on the MessageWeave engine to intercept and react to
operations:

```ts
const flow = createMessageWeave({
  storage,
  hooks: {
    // Validate or authorize before sequence assignment.
    // Throwing an error aborts the publish without consuming a sequence ID.
    beforePublish: async (input) => {
      if (input.content.bannedWord) {
        throw new Error("Prohibited content");
      }
    },

    // Asynchronously react after an event has been persisted.
    // Runs outside the sequencer lock to keep allocations high-throughput.
    onPublish: async (event, context) => {
      await sendPushNotifications(event);
    },

    // Triggered after a room is successfully created.
    onRoomCreated: async (room, input) => {
      console.log(`Room created: ${room.id}`);
    },
  },
});
```
